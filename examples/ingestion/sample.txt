EmergentDB is a self-optimizing vector database.

It uses the MAP-Elites evolutionary algorithm to automatically discover
the optimal index configuration for your specific workload.

Key features:
- 44-193x faster than LanceDB
- 10-25x faster than ChromaDB
- 99%+ recall guarantee
- SIMD-optimized insertion strategies
- Automatic index type selection (Flat, HNSW, IVF)

The system maintains a dual quality-diversity approach:
1. IndexQD - evolves index types and hyperparameters
2. InsertQD - evolves SIMD insertion strategies

Built with Rust for maximum performance.
