Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.

It involves training algorithms on data to make predictions
or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Common types of machine learning:
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning (reward-based learning)

Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
